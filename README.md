# TU Food Trucks
Howdy! We are TU Food Trucks. We aim to provide quality service to those in the Towson University area by allowing students to view the schedules and menus of food trucks that are on or near campus! We believe this will improve the quality-of-life of TU students by letting them know when a food truck is nearby so they can quickly and efficiently purchase a nice meal before or after class. After all, not everybody has time to eat in a dining hall or walk across campus to find a spot to eat breakfast, lunch, or dinner!

# II. Basic Usage
1. Unfortunately, the login page does not function at the current stage of development. To circumvent this, we have implemented a button that takes the user directly to the food trucks page in the top left corner!
2. When the "To Trucks" button is pressed, you will see a list of each food truck available in the area:

3. The "View" button under the name of each truck will present you with the location, rating, schedule, and website for that specific truck. For example...

4. When selecting the "Menu" button underneath a particular food truck, that food truck's menu items will be displayed. The example below is an image of the Pizza Boys menu:

# III. Alan AI
1. Our team has carefully crafted an AI chat bot using the Alan SDK found here: ![Alan Android SDK](https://alan.app/docs/client-api/android/android-api/).

2. To access Alan AI, tap the blue button on the bottom right of your phone's screen (circled below):

3. As of the current build, Alan will only take voice commands. The entire script can be found here: ![TU Food Trucks Alan Script](https://github.com/Arctic-Bird/SWEN-Project/blob/main/TU_Food_Trucks_Alan_Script.txt).

4. For example, if you want recommendations for food, simply say "Food recommendations" and Alan will ask if you want vegetarian, meat, seafood, or sides!


# IV. Bug Reporting
1. As humans, we are imperfect. While we strive for excellent quality with our software, our code is still susceptible to bugs like any other program. We have thus created a discussion board for bug reporting, and we also encourage users to open a new issue on our Issues page if a bug is found. The links to the Discussion board and the Issues page are listed below.

   a. Discussion board: ![Report bugs here!](https://github.com/Arctic-Bird/SWEN-Project/discussions/1)
   
   b. Issues page: ![Also report bugs here!](https://github.com/Arctic-Bird/SWEN-Project/issues)

# V. The Future
We thank you for viewing and downloading our new TU Food Trucks mobile app. We have many exciting new features planned for the future that we can't wait for you to witness and get your hands on. This includes:
1. Food truck owner registration and verification: This will allow food truck owners to register their food truck in our system to promote their business, for a small one-time fee!
2. Food truck tracking: We intend to implement a GPS system which will allow students and other users to view the real-time locations of food trucks in the TU area.
3. AI improvements: We hope to implement a text chat feature for our Alan AI assistant, allowing users to choose their preferred communication method!
