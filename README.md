# II. Basic Usage
1. Unfortunately, the login page does not function at the current stage of development. To circumvent this, we have implemented a button that takes the user directly to the food trucks page in the top left corner!
2. When the "To Trucks" button is pressed, you will see a list of each food truck available in the area:

3. The "View" button under the name of each truck will present you with the location, rating, schedule, and website for that specific truck. For example...

4. When selecting the "Menu" button underneath a particular food truck, that food truck's menu items will be displayed. The example below is an image of the Pizza Boys menu:

# III. Alan AI
1. Our team has carefully crafted an AI chat bot using the Alan SDK found here: ![link](https://alan.app/docs/client-api/android/android-api/).

2. To access Alan AI, tap the blue button on the bottom right of your phone's screen (circled below):

3. As of the current build, Alan will only take voice commands. The entire script can be found here: ![link](https://github.com/Arctic-Bird/SWEN-Project/blob/main/TU_Food_Trucks_Alan_Script.txt).

4. For example, if you want recommendations for food, simply say "Food recommendations" and Alan will ask if you want vegetarian, meat, seafood, or sides!


# IV. Bug Reporting
1. As humans, we are imperfect. While we strive for excellent quality with our software, our code is still susceptible to bugs like any other program. We have thus created a discussion board for bug reporting, and we also encourage users to open a new issue on our Issues page if a bug is found. The links to the Discussion board and the Issues page are listed below.

   a. Discussion board: ![link](https://github.com/Arctic-Bird/SWEN-Project/discussions/1)
   
   b. Issues page: ![link](https://github.com/Arctic-Bird/SWEN-Project/issues)
