# II. Basic Usage
1. Unfortunately, the login page does not function at the current stage of development. To circumvent this, we have implemented a button that takes the user directly to the food trucks page in the top left corner!
2. When the "To Trucks" button is pressed, you will see a list of each food truck available in the area:

3. The "View" button under the name of each truck will present you with the location, rating, schedule, and website for that specific truck. For example...
